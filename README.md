# Tetris
The following is my implementation of the game Tetris with simple GUI. It was coded in spring of 2020.
### How to use
First click Start button. As in the usual game of Tetris, figure moving is done by clicking Left and Right arrows. 
To make the block fall immediately, click the Down arrow. To change the orientation, click Up arrow. The next figure is shown in the smaller grid.
Here is how the interface looks like:
